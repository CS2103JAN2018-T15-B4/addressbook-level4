== PROJECT: BizConnect Journal

---

== Overview

BizConnect Journal is a dedicated application catered to busy businessmen, especially those who travel a lot.
This app helps to manage their wide range of contacts, events and tasks. It also uses Command Line Interface (CLI) as the primary source of input.

Businessmen tend to have a lot of meetings and networking sessions with new people which includes the exchange of contacts,
thus the above features will be useful for them as they can access all of them in one application without the trouble
of a separate application for each individual purpose.

At any point in time, the businessman can refer to the calendar and its event list to keep track of upcoming major events, thereby allowing a clear idea on
what his current schedule is like. In addition, the task list comes in handy to update the user of pending tasks and the tasksâ€™ urgency.
This helps them prioritise what needs to be done first.

Besides that, traveling in foreign countries also involves the hassle of not knowing the appropriate amount of money to change.
Hence, the currency converter aims to facilitate the fast and accurate knowledge of the amount to change without the need of a separate online converter application.

A simple day-to-day life of a businessman can be packed with many schedules and having a single tool to manage
all their necessary work information makes things easier, as well as save them valuable time and effort.
With all these goals in mind, BizConnect Journal is developed to ease the management of the busy schedules of businessmen.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Event feature to facilitate *event management*

** *What it does*:
It allows the businessman to add, delete, find, and list all tasks.
Each event consists of a title, description, location, date and time.

** *Justification*:
This feature enhances the product as users are now able to manage their events easily with simple add and delete event commands.
The user is able to store each event with the vital information like the agenda, location, date and timing of the activity,
as well as provide a short description of what the event is about. Furthermore, the event list displays all these events alongside the calendar, as the calendar
is able to visually display the days of a month with events. In addition, each listed event has a visual setting to display which events are coming soon,
ongoing, or already over. This facilitates convenient event management as the user is able to list down all events and gain a brief overview of his schedule.
With these functionalities, the user does not need to worry about forgetting an event ever again!

** *Highlights*: This enhancements involves an Event Book that works hand-in-hand with the Address Book under a single application for businessmen when it comes
to managing contacts and events. The implementation was difficult as a new Event Book system had to be constructed, which compromised of many classes working together.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an Export Command which exports the contacts on the Address Book into either XML or CSV files.
XML files allows for easy exportability across other platforms requiring the use of contacts stored in XML format, while the
exported CSV file is designed to help the user import contacts from the Address Book into his Google Contacts.
