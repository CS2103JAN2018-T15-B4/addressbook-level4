== Overview

BizConnect Journal is a dedicated application catered to busy businessmen, especially those who travel a lot.
This app helps to manage their wide range of contacts, events and tasks. It also uses Command Line Interface (CLI) as the primary source of input.

Businessmen tend to have a lot of meetings and networking sessions with new people which includes the exchange of contacts,
thus the above features will be useful for them as they can access all of them in one application without the trouble
of a separate application for each individual purpose.

At any point in time, the businessman can refer to the calendar and its event list to keep track of upcoming major events, thereby allowing a clear idea on
what his current schedule is like. In addition, the task list comes in handy to update the user of pending tasks and the tasksâ€™ urgency.
This helps them prioritise what needs to be done first.

Besides that, traveling in foreign countries also involves the hassle of not knowing the appropriate amount of money to change.
Hence, the currency converter aims to facilitate the fast and accurate knowledge of the amount to change without the need of a separate online converter application.

A simple day-to-day life of a businessman can be packed with many schedules and having a single tool to manage
all their necessary work information makes things easier, as well as save them valuable time and effort.
With all these goals in mind, BizConnect Journal is developed to ease the management of the busy schedules of businessmen.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
